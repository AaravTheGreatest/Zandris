EVERY CLASS THAT ISN'T A BASE CLASS HAS THEIR OWN "OP" ABILITY!!
You're able to upgrade from base classes after level 20, and if you want to switch classes, you get to do so at a cost (check the shop in the game!)

Humans:
    Base class, no special stat boosts, but you get compatibility with all abilities.
    Priest:
        No compatibility with corruption/ dark abilities, but you get a boost with healing and some select magic abilities.
    Berserker:
        Get buffs on strength type abilities, and you get access to a special set of abilites.

Elves:
    Base class, get buffs with elf type abilities. Any abilities from a different race get slight debuffs.
    High Elf:
        You get access to special abilities, and your "nature affinity" gets boosted, meaning natural abilites get buffs, but you're weaker against things with a higher rank than you due to a sense of pride.
    Dark Elf:
        You get access to special abilites, and your "darkness affinity" gets boosted, but you're weaker against things with light abilities due to a bond with the spirit of darkness.

Wizards:
    Higher magic affinity, but you're debuffed with close range combat.
    Warlock:
        You get to choose a speciality and get buffs on spells of that type, this can only be changed if you develop a debuff or loose affinity for a type of magic, and once changed, cannot be changed back until you loose the debuff and gain a debuff for your new specialty. All conflicting types of magic are severly debuffed.
