Zandris is set in a post-apocolyptic world, Zandris is a survival style RPG game with a twist. From the very beginning, the OP boss is hunting the player down and trying to kill them, as the player has a very unique ability; they can respawn a certain number of times, and this ability is passed onto the killer of said player. As the player progresses, they can gain both offensive and defensive abilities. The player doesn't have predetermined abilities based on a "class" like other games. Instead, the abilities that the player gains are salvageable across lives, but they can only carry over a certain amount of abilities per life. As the player saves more abilities, the build up an "innate ability", having affinities for some types of abilities, while debuffs/ weaknesses to others. If they save too many contrasting abilities, they'd better hope they're good at melee, since that's their only hope. The player can gain abilities from experience, grimoires, learning or killing enemies. Some artifacts also have powers that aren't affected by the player's affinities & debuffs, only their artifact sets that they resonate with. Bad resonance is also a thing, so chose artifacts wisely! The end goal is to defeat the boss that's hunting the player, but don't fret, the open world is still available to explore, and who knows? They may run into stronger enemies that want the power the player wields. If you're able to defeat everything there is to offer, you may have to finally face the creator of Zandris themself...
